# Superior Elements

## Problem statement
There is an integer array ‘a’ of size ‘n’.

An element is called a Superior Element if it is greater than all the elements present to its right.

You must return an array all Superior Elements in the array ‘a’.

<b>Note:</b>

The last element of the array is always a Superior Element. 


<b>Example:</b>

<u>Input:</u> a = [1, 2, 3, 2], n = 4

<u>Output:</u> 2 3

Explanation: 
a[ 2 ] = 3 is greater than a[ 3 ]. Hence it is a Superior Element. 

a[ 3 ] = 2 is the last element. Hence it is a Superior Element.

The final answer is in sorted order.
