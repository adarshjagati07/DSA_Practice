# Longest Successive Element
## Problem statement
There is an integer array ‘A’ of size ‘N’.

A sequence is successive when the adjacent elements of the sequence have a difference of 1.

You must return the length of the longest successive sequence.

<b>Note:</b>

You can reorder the array to form a sequence. 
For example,

Input:
A = [5, 8, 3, 2, 1, 4], N = 6

Output:
5

<b>Explanation: </b>

The resultant sequence can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.    

The length of the sequence is 5.
