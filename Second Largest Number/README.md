Problem statement
You have been given an array ‘a’ of ‘n’ unique non-negative integers.



Find the second largest and second smallest element from the array.



Return the two elements (second largest and second smallest) as another array of size 2.



Example :
Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘a’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [4, 2]

The second largest element after 5 is 4, and the second smallest element after 1 is 2.

Sample Input 1 :
4
3 4 5 2
Sample Output 1 :
4 3
Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
The second largest element after 5 is 4 only, and the second smallest element after 2 is 3.
Sample Input 2 :
5
4 5 3 6 7
Sample Output 2 :
6 4
Expected Time Complexity:
O(n), Where ‘n’ is the size of an input array ‘a’.
Constraints:
2 ≤ 'n' ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ 'a'[i] ≤ 10^9

Time limit: 1 sec
