## Example

**Input:**
- ‘n’ = 5, ‘a’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Output:**
- [4, 2]

**Explanation:**
- The second largest element after 5 is 4, and the second smallest element after 1 is 2.

## Detailed Explanation

### Input/Output Format

**Sample Input 1:**
```
4
3 4 5 2
```


**Sample Output 1:**
```
4 3
```


### Expected Time Complexity

O(n), Where ‘n’ is the size of an input array ‘a’.

### Constraints

- 2 ≤ 'n' ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ 'a'[i] ≤ 10^9

**Time limit: 1 sec**
